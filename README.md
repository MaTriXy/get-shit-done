## Motivation

Lately, I've been struggling with "time management" as the number of tasks is always bigger than the amount of time we have on our hands, therefore in order to achieve maximum efficiency it's crucial to prioritize in a deterministic matter.

“Get shit done” relies heavily on 3 factors

⭐ Urgency
Can this wait? What are the implications of this to be completed next week? 
‘Urgency’ will weight out tasks with deadlines and things you’ve postponed for a while now.

⭐ Impact
How much difference will it make if you complete this task today? 
Let's say you want to install a password manager, or fix an annoying (but not a critical) bug, or switch your provider due to a better plan.
What do all these examples have in common? none of these are urgent but they will make a hack whole lot of difference for you or your customers.

⭐ Easiness
Is this a quickly solvable task? If so, get it done fast and move on with your life. Things like “answer bobs’ message”, “send a fax” or
“return Mike’s charger” — all of these have no strong impact nor sense of urgency, but keeping them in your list will stress you out whereas completing them takes only a few seconds and helps you achieve the sense of “accomplishment”, which is very important to “get the ball rolling”.
